# TBD
* Simplify service config definition to a single method
* Add a CI check to make sure changelog is updated each commit
* Use custom types for service and configuration IDs, so that the user doesn't have a ton of `int`s flying around
* Made TestExecutor take in the long list of test params as constructor arguments, rather than in the runTest() method, to simplify the code
* Make setup/teardown buffer configurable on a per-test basis with `GetSetupBuffer` method
* Passing networks by id instead of name inside docker manager
* Added a "Debugging failed tests" tutorial
* Bugfix for broken CI checks that don't verify CHANGELOG is actually modified
* Pass network ID instead of network name to the controller
* Switching FreeIpAddrTracker to pass net.IP objects instead of strings

# 0.7.0
* Allow developers to configure how wide their test networks will be
* Make `TestSuiteRunner.RunTests` take in a set of tests (rather than a list) to more accurately reflect what's happening
* Remove `ServiceSocket`, which is an Ava-specific notion
* Add a step-by-step tutorial for writing a Kurtosis implementation!

# 0.6.0
* Clarified the README with additional information about what happens during Kurtosis exit, normal and abnormal, and how to clean up leftover resources
* Add a test-execution-global timeout, so that a hang during setup won't block Kurtosis indefinitely
* Switch the `panickingLogWriter` for a log writer that merely captures system-level log events during parallel test execution, because it turns out the Docker client uses logrus and will call system-level logging events too
* `DockerManager` no longer stores a Context, and instead takes it in for each of its functions (per Go's recommendation)
* To enable the test timeout use case, try to stop all containers attached to a network before removing it (otherwise removing the network will guaranteed fail)
* Normalize banners in output and make them bigger

# 0.5.0
* Remove return value of `DockerManager.CreateVolume`, which was utterly useless
* Create & tear down a new Docker network per test, to pave the way for parallel tests
* Move FreeIpAddrTracker a little closer to handling IPv6
* Run tests in parallel!
* Print errors directly, rather than rendering them through logrus, to preserve newlines
* Fixed bug where the `TEST RESULTS` section was displaying in nondeterministic order
* Switch to using `nat.Port` object to represent ports to allow for non-TCP ports

# 0.4.0
* remove freeHostPortTracker and all host-container port mappings
* Make tests declare a timeout and mark them as failed if they don't complete in that time
* Explicitly declare which IP will be the gateway IP in managed subnets
* Refactored the big `for` loop inside `TestSuiteRunner.RunTests` into a separate helper function
* Use `defer` to stop the testnet after it's created, so we stop it even in the event of unanticipated panics
* Allow tests to stop network nodes
* Force the user to provide a static service configuration ID when running `ConfigureNetwork` (rather than leaving it autogenerated), so they can reference it later when running their test if they wanted to add a service during the test
* Fix very nasty bug with tests passing when they shouldn't
* Added stacktraces for `TestContext.AssertTrue` by letting the user pass in an `error` that's thrown when the assertion fails

# 0.3.1
* explicitly specify service IDs in network configurations

# 0.3.0
* Stop the node network after the test controller runs
* Rename ServiceFactory(,Config) -> ServiceInitializer(,Core)
* Fix bug with not actually catching panics when running a test
* Fix a bug with the TestController not appropriately catching panics
* Log test result as soon as the test is finished
* Add some extra unit tests
* Implement controller log propagation
* Allow services to declare arbitrary file-based dependencies (necessary for staking)
